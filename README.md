# TIC-TAC-TOE
This is a simple yet interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Flask for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend. The game allows two players to play in a turn-based manner, with real-time updates to the game board. Players can restart the game at any point, and the game provides feedback for win conditions, ties, and invalid moves.
